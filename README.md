Dead Simple Email Subscriptions

Mailbag lets you quickly and easily drop a MailChimp subscription form into your post, page or widget area. Simply add your MailChimp API key, choose a list to subscribe users to, and add a shortcode to your page. Mailbag ships with minimal front-end styles that can be disabled if you'd rather inherit styles from your theme.

Mailbag is super simple by design. If you're looking for a MailChimp plugin with more options, check out the MailChimp for WordPress plugin.
